# Draft: Mini-WhitePaper for SoulBound Protocol

- [中文版本](https://github.com/SoulBoundxyz/WhitePaper/blob/main/miniWhitePaper-cn.md) 

## Introduction

At present, the NFT market is developing rapidly, and many users already own NFTs. These NFTs are transferable, and users can use money to buy other people's NFTs. This is of course very good: Visionaries can get it for free or at a low price in the early stage of the project, and then choose the opportunity to sell it at a high price to take profit. But if this NFT is to commemorate some unique experience, then it should be non-transferable. Vitalik advocated in a January 2022 [blog](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) that some NFTs should be `soulbound` and cannot be transferrable. The founders of Soulbound protocol has the same vision as vitalik, and will do their best to build a non-transferable Soulbound protocol for projects and users. 

Our products will first supports ETH and layer-2 sidechains.

Soulbound Protocol has the following characteristics:
- Soulbound
- Protocol level

### 2. Protocol level (Protocol)
Soulbound is an open protocol, we will build an ecosystem around it, and encourage projects and developers to join.
